## Hi, I'm TJ üëã
I'm a Senior DevOps Consultant with InCycle Software.
As a consultant, I work with a verity of clients in a variety of industries to help them improve their development practices.
I come largely from a developer background but have spent time on the operations side of IT.
I was one of those guys adovcating for DevOps long before it was even called DevOps.
I've worked on projects ranging from fixing/improving CI/CD pipelines, building out cloud automation, agile coaching and everything in between.

## üå± Currently Learning
I'm currently learning about Kubernetes with the goal of becoming a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer.
For those that are not aware of what Kubernetes is, it basically a container orchastration platform.
If you haven't yet, I strongly suggest taking a look at.
While it is a great tool that solves a lot of challenges with containers, it brings with it a whole new set of challenges.
The story of IT, right? üòÅ
